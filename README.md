- **Blue aircraft**: Arrivals/Departures (near airports)
- **Green aircraft**: Domestic flights
- **Orange aircraft**: Transit traffic
- **Gray aircraft**: Ground operations

### Alert Levels
- üü¢ **LOW**: <70% capacity utilization
- üü° **MEDIUM**: 70-85% capacity utilization
- üî¥ **HIGH**: >85% capacity utilization (requires intervention)

## üîß Configuration

### Refresh Settings
- **Manual refresh**: Click "Refresh Data" button
- **Auto-refresh**: Enable 60-second automatic updates
- **Display filters**: Show overflights only, sector information

### Data Sources
- **OpenSky Network API**: Real-time ADS-B aircraft data
- **Coverage**: Global aircraft with ADS-B transponders
- **Update frequency**: Real-time (API dependent)

## üìà Key Metrics

### Traffic Classification
- **Overflights**: Aircraft >20,000ft not near airports
- **Domestic**: Aircraft <20,000ft within Iraqi airspace
- **Arrivals/Departures**: Aircraft within 50km of airports
- **Ground**: Aircraft on airport surfaces

### Capacity Management
- **Sector limits**: Based on controller workload capacity
- **Alert thresholds**: 70% (warning), 85% (critical)
